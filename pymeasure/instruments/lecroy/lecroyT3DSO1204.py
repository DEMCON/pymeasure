    """ Represents the LeCroy T3DSO1204 Oscilloscope interface for interacting with the instrument.

    Refer to the LeCroy T3DSO1204 Oscilloscope Programmer's Guide for further details about
    using the lower-level methods to interact directly with the scope.

    Attributes:
        WRITE_INTERVAL_S: minimum time between two commands. If a command is received less than
        WRITE_INTERVAL_S after the previous one, the code blocks until at least WRITE_INTERVAL_S
        seconds have passed.
        Because the oscilloscope takes a non neglibile time to perform some operations, it might
        be needed for the user to tweak the sleep time between commands.
        The WRITE_INTERVAL_S is set to 10ms as default however its optimal value heavily depends
        on the actual commands and on the connection type, so it is impossible to give a unique
        value to fit all cases. An interval between 10ms and 500ms second proved to be good,
        depending on the commands and connection latency.
